// Remember don't over-use generic columns. These are here for quick helpers/prototyping or where it makes sense to use
// something so generic. Keep in mind that we should be able to adjust the values under the mobile and tablet breakpoint
// to anything without the risk of breaking the mobile layout elsewhere in the site. So if you've used a col-3 for one
// element, expect that the mobile value can be adjusted everywhere equally.
// If unsure use a proper named column in _layout
